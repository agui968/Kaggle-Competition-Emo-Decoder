# EmoDecoder_Kaggle
Working on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/emodecode-3000) to classify images and determine the mood of a person.

For these ML models, we mainly used Keras and neural networks with several parameters in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions of the seven different categories. We also had to balance the number of samples of each category in order to train the model properly with different methods.
